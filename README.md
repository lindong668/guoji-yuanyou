# PriceScope

Multilingual (7 languages) price site on **Cloudflare Workers** — SSR rendered, so Google crawlers and users see real numbers in the HTML.

- **Site**: https://you.piccalc.com
- **Data**: your existing Worker `https://ss.wwok.eu.cc/data`
- **Stack**: Cloudflare Workers (ES modules) + free exchange-rate API

## 1. What you get

| Route | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Overview (oil + gold + China fuel + FX summary) |
| `/oil/` | International crude oil |
| `/gold/` | Gold (USD/oz + CNY/gram) |
| `/china-fuel/` | All 31 China provinces, 92/95/98/0# |
| `/currency/` | Currency converter + popular pairs |
| `/privacy/` | Privacy Policy (follows UI language) |
| `/about/` | About |
| `/contact/` | Contact |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Multilingual sitemap with hreflang |
| `/robots.txt` | Crawler rules + sitemap link |

**Languages**: `en` (default) · `zh` · `ja` · `es` · `fr` · `de` · `pt`
Visitors are auto-redirected based on their browser `Accept-Language`, and can switch any time from the dropdown (switching writes the language into the URL — good for SEO).

## 2. Deploy (5 minutes)

```bash
cd pricescope
npm install          # installs wrangler
npx wrangler login   # authorise your Cloudflare account
npx wrangler deploy
```

After the first deploy, attach your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard:
**Workers & Pages → pricescope → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add** → `you.piccalc.com`

> Make sure `you.piccalc.com` is already on Cloudflare (it is, since your other Worker is there).

---

## 3. Turn on Google AdSense

Open `src/ui.js` and set your publisher ID:

```js
export const ADSENSE_CLIENT = 'ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
```

Then in `src/pages.js` replace `data-ad-slot="0000000000000000"` with the real ad slot IDs you create in AdSense.

Redeploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

Before applying to AdSense, make sure these URLs return real content:
- `/en/privacy/`
- `/en/about/`
- `/en/contact/`

AdSense reviewers check these three specifically. They are already written as full, genuine content in all 7 languages — not placeholders.

## 4. Data refresh frequency

Data is fetched from your source Worker and cached at the Cloudflare edge:

| Data | Cache TTL |
|---|---|
| Market data (`/data`) | 5 minutes |
| Exchange rates | 1 hour |

To change it, edit the numbers at the bottom of `src/data.js`:

```js
const raw = await fetchCached(SOURCE_WORKER, 300);  // seconds
const raw = await fetchCached(FX_ENDPOINT, 3600);   // seconds
```

Your source Worker controls how often it *collects* the data; this site controls how often it *re-reads* it.

## 5. Files

```
src/i18n.js    7-language dictionary + province name map + browser-language detection
src/data.js    fetch/normalise your /data payload + exchange rates
src/ui.js      design system (CSS), SEO head (canonical, hreflang, JSON-LD), nav/footer
src/pages.js   page renderers
src/index.js   router
wrangler.toml  deploy config
```

### Notes on your data payload
Your source returns mixed Chinese/Latin keys. `src/data.js` already handles all variants:
- province key: `省` / `省份` / `province`
- oil: `油` (with `价格`, `格式化后`)
- gold: `金子` (`priceUsdPerOz`, `priceCnyPerGram`)
- CN fuel: `cn_oil.list`

If your source Worker ever changes a field name, only `normalise()` in `src/data.js` needs updating.

## 6. Optional: persistent cache

Right now caching uses the Cloudflare Cache API + per-isolate memory (no setup needed).
If you want the cache to survive across deploys, create a KV namespace and bind it as `PRICESCOPE_CACHE` in `wrangler.toml`.
